Fleas acquire this organism via blood meal from a bacteremic mammal, usually a rodent. To produce a transmissible infection, <italic>Y. pestis </italic>colonizes the flea midgut and forms a biofilm in the proventricular valve optimally at 20 to 26°C, blocking its normal blood feeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Human beings are occasionally infected by directly contacting infected animals or by being bitten by the blocked fleas. Thus, <italic>Y. pestis </italic>must experience a temperature shift during the transmission process between rodents, fleas, and humans. It is considered a facultative intracellular pathogen. After the initial subcutaneous invasion, the bacteria migrate into the regional lymph nodes via the subcutaneous lymph vessel. Most of the organisms that invade the lymph nodes are engulfed and killed by the polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) that are attracted to invasion sites in large numbers. However, a few bacilli are taken up by tissue macrophages, providing a fastidious and unoccupied niche for <italic>Y. pestis </italic>to synthesize virulence determinants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Residence in this niche also facilitates the bacteria's resistance to phagocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The moiety escaped from macrophages can multiply outside of host cells and eventually cause systemic infection. The hypothesized prevailing conditions of phagolysosomal microenvironments include acidic pH, oxidative stress, iron scavenging, nutrition limitation, and killing or inhibiting activities of antibacterial peptides. To survive these stressful environments, <italic>Y. pestis </italic>likely makes appropriate adaptive responses, primarily reflected by the transcriptional changes of specific sets of genes.</p><p>A DNA microarray is able to determine simultaneous changes in all the genes of a cell at the mRNA level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. We and others have measured the gene expression profiles of <italic>Y. pestis </italic>in response to a variety of stimulating conditions (stimulon analysis), including temperature alteration tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], increased osmolarity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], ion deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], antibiotic treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], oxidative and acidic stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], antibacterial peptide treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and nutrition limitation. We also identified the regulons controlled by each of the regulatory proteins, Fur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], PhoP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], OmpR, and OxyR, by comparing the gene expression patterns of the mutant transcriptional regulator with that of its parental strain. In order to acquire more regulatory information, all available microarray data of <italic>Y. pestis </italic>including those published signature expression profiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] were collected and subjected to clustering analysis, which infers functionality to the clusters of co-regulated genes.</p><p>The transcriptional and genomic information gleaned from coordinately regulated genes was also used to computationally search for potential operons (operon prediction) and <italic>cis</italic>-acting DNA regulatory motifs (motif discovery). Some important findings were further verified by biochemical experiments, including RT-PCR and gel shift assays. This analysis provides an opportunity to gain a global view of environmental modulation of gene expression patterns in <italic>Y. pestis</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><p>Comprehensive analysis of large sets of microarray expression data is useful to dissect bacterial adaptation to various environments and to understand bacterial gene transcriptional regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. For example, Kendall and his colleagues have compared the general responses of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis </italic>induced by a variety of different <italic>in vitro </italic>conditions (low pH, low nutrients, nitrogen, oxygen stress, stationary phase, and nutrition starvation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. After the determination of the CsrA, SlyA, and PhoPQ regulons in <italic>Samonella typhimurium</italic>, the relevant regulon members are monitored to define the synergetic or antagonistic roles between these three regulators in cell infection models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Recently, many signature expression profiles of <italic>Y. pestis </italic>have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. All the microarray expression data from our laboratory were analyzed using standardized microarray procedures such that they are suitable for comprehensive analysis. Comparative transcriptomics analysis presented here can be used to mine the regulatory information from these available microarray data, providing an opportunity to gain a global view on environmental modulation of gene expression in <italic>Y. pestis</italic>. This analysis provides an additional dividend towards the transcriptional regulatory networks of <italic>Y. pestis</italic>.</p><sec><title>Virulence genes in response to multiple environmental stresses</title><p>In this work, 25 expression profiles of <italic>Y. pestis </italic>were collected for further integration. We hypothesize that the stress conditions used in these experiments will be encountered by this bacterium during its infection and life cycle. The data supported the notion that <italic>Y. pestis </italic>has evolved its ability to coordinately regulate a wide set of genes to survive a wide range of environmental perturbations. Almost all of the known virulence genes were active in the stress responses. Thus, identification of the expression patterns of virulence genes upon a wide set of environmental changes will provide a reference to screen for uncharacterized genes that shown the same differential gene expression under the same stressful conditions.</p><p>The transmission and infection of <italic>Y. pestis </italic>can be roughly divided into stages of maintain in fleas, adhesion to host surface, invasion into epithelial or endothelial cells, intracellular growth, antiphagocytosis, and extracellular proliferation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). <italic>Y. pestis </italic>possesses a set of virulence determinants that promote infection in mammalian hosts and/or transmission by flea vectors, and different virulence genes have been proven or proposed to be involved in different infection stages (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Environmental modulation of expression of virulence genes</bold>.

Our data showed that <italic>Y. pestis </italic>known virulence genes also respond to other environmental stresses besides temperature shift (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). For example, the hemin storage locus, <italic>hmsHFRS </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], was repressed by temperature upshift, high osmolarity, nutrition limitation, and streptomycin treatment. The <italic>ymt </italic>gene encoding <italic>Yersinia </italic>murine toxin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] was also regulated by temperature upshift and streptomycin treatment.</p><p><italic>Y. pestis </italic>synthesizes several antiphagocytic factors, including F1 capsular antigen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], pH6 antigen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and <italic>Yersinia </italic>outer proteins (Yops) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Expression of Yops was regulated by temperature alteration, increased osmolarity, and nutrition deficiency under normal Ca<sup>2+ </sup>condition. These data suggest that the low-calcium response of type III secretion system (T3SS) appears to be triggered at the mRNA level by other environmental cues in addition to temperature upshift and Ca<sup>2+ </sup>limitation. F1 capsular antigen is expressed much more at 37°C than at 26°C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. pH6 antigen (PsaA), encoded by the chromosomal <italic>psaA </italic>gene, expresses <italic>in vitro </italic>between pH 5 and 6.7 at 35 to 41°C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], or when bacteria live within phagocytic phagolysome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The <italic>psaEFABC </italic>operon encodes a chaperone/usher pathway involved in the secretion and assembly of pH6 antigen as a polymer (fimbriae) on the surface of <italic>Y. pestis </italic>in macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. PsaE is thought to be a positive regulator of the <italic>psaABC </italic>locus and is required for maximal expression of the pH6 antigen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. A recent study showed that the <italic>psaEFABC </italic>locus is regulated by RovA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The microarray data showed that the F1 operon was upregulated upon temperature upshift, low pH medium, oxidative stress, low Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and nutrition deficiency, while the <italic>psaEFABC </italic>locus was induced by temperature alteration, acid stress, low Mg<sup>2+</sup>, nutrition limitation, high salinity and hyperosmotic stress. It is reasonable to assume that synergetic operation of complicated microenvironments within mammalian hosts account for the full expression of these two loci.</p></sec><sec><title>Prediction of operons from microarray data</title><p>Operon prediction is the first step toward elucidating gene regulation and reconstructing regulatory networks. Most approaches for prokaryotic operon prediction were developed on the basis of genomic and/or phylogenetic information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. For these methods, training with experimental information of known operons is required to generate the predictors. However, little experimental data of operon structure is currently available for <italic>Y. pestis</italic>. To predict the potential operons of <italic>Y. pestis</italic>, we attempted a method that incorporated the empirical correlation coefficient from microarray expression data with the genomic annotation data, including gene orientation, intergenic distance, functional similarity, and intra-genome conservation.</p></sec><sec><title>Stress-responsive operons predicted from microarray expression data</title><p>By using the criteria described in Methods, we identified 39 potential operons that consisted of 183 genes in <italic>Y. pestis </italic>(Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Nineteen of these potential operons have been previously studied in other bacteria. There was good agreement between our results and a recent report in which the adjacent genes of <italic>Y. pestis </italic>CO92 are predicted to be within an operon based on the greater conservation of operons in multiple species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Stress-responsive operons in <italic>Y. pestis </italic>predicted from microarray expression data</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><bold>Potential operon (r value)</bold></td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><bold>Gene ID</bold></td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><bold>Putative or predicted function</bold></td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><bold>Reference (s)</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="4" rowspan="1"><bold>Iron uptake or heme synthesis</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"> <italic>yfeABCD </italic>operon* (r &gt;

The advantage of our strategy is that a high accuracy rate would be achieved by integrating microarray experimental data with genomic information. Although there are many bioinformatics tools available for predicting operons, results presented here demonstrated a new reliable strategy for operon prediction and verification, which will be helpful for functional studies. However, only a small number of operons could be predicted, due to the fact i) that only stress-responsive genes were included for this analysis, and ii) that a lot of contiguous gene pairs passed the criteria, but incomplete array data made it difficult to define the border of their primary mRNA transcripts (for example, the extension of a predicted operon, YPO0881-0882 to YPO0881-0884, was demonstrated by RT-PCR as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2d</xref>)</p></sec><sec><title>Functional inference of clustering, uncharacterized genes</title><p>Clustering microarray expression data can be viewed as a data reduction process, in that observations of gene expression in each cluster can be over-represented (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). This process provides much greater insight into functional classes of co-expressed genes, since genes that are functionally related should be co-regulated and consequently should show similar expression profiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Thus, clustering genes with similar expression patterns can potentially be utilized to predict the functions of gene products with unknown functions, and to identify sets of genes that are co-expressed and may play the same roles in different cell cycles. We analyzed the expression data with unsupervised algorithms and identified four clusters of co-expressed genes that were associated with ribosome biosynthesis, iron/heme assimilation, and sulfur and energy metabolism. The possible roles of uncharacterized genes may be inferred by referencing other members in each cluster.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Schematic representation of the clustered microarray data</bold>.

Therefore, RNA was extracted from cells grown at these three temperatures, as done in microarray experiments. Primer pairs were designed for each adjacent gene studied, such that a PCR amplicon across the intergenic region of the two genes would be produced when genomic DNA was used as template (see Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription with 5 μg of RNA, 200 U of Superscript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and 3 μg of random hexamer primers. A sample of the resulting cDNA (5 μl) was used for PCR amplification. PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. To ensure that there was no contamination of genomic DNA, negative controls were performed using RT products with no addition of reverse transcriptase. Reactions containing primer pairs without cDNA template were also included as blank controls.</p></sec><sec><title>Clustering analysis</title><p>Genes were clustered according to their expression patterns in the twenty-five different experiments using Cluster 3.0 software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Before clustering, genes with expression data in less than three experiments were removed in order to limit the effects of missing values in the clustering analyses. Of the original 4005 probes, the remaining 3339 probes were used for further clustering analysis. For the original and the filtered data, self-organizing map (SOM) program first ran on the whole microarray dataset to cluster the genes based on the similarity of their expression profiles. The output files were then processed by hierarchical clustering by using the average linkage method. Correlation coefficients of more than 0.6 were arbitrarily extracted and visualized with TreeView [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>] to graphically display the data by coloring each cell on the basis of the fluorescence ratio. Cells with log ratios of 0 (no change in gene expression) are colored in black; increasing values of positive and negative log ratios are labeled with increasing intensities of red and green, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Discovery of regulatory DNA motifs</title><p>For each cluster of co-expressed genes, neighboring genes were grouped into potential operon structures as described above. Promoter-proximate DNA sequences (400 bp upstream to 50 bp downstream of the start codon of each single-gene transcriptional unit, or the first gene of each operon) were retrieved from the genomic sequence of <italic>Y. pesti</italic>s <italic>91001 </italic>with the <italic>retrieve-sequence </italic>tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Collections of promoter sequences from co-expressed genes within each cluster were searched for potential regulatory DNA motifs with the multiple expectation maximization for motif elicitation (MEME) program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>].</p><p>10–30 bases of a single motif and at least 3 distinct motifs in each run were specified. The first two significant (low <italic>E</italic>-value) motifs except AT-rich motifs were chosen for further analysis. The symmetrical or dyad elements were preferentially selected. Then, the sequence logos were built by compilation of the conserved sequences detected in the analysis for each motif with the <italic>WebLogo </italic>program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Finally, PSSM for each DNA motif were built with the <italic>consensus </italic>and convert-matrix tools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Gel mobility shift analysis of Fur binding</title><p>The entire coding region of the <italic>fur </italic>gene of <italic>Y. pestis </italic>strain 201 was cloned into pET28a (Novagen, San Diego, CA). Recombinant plasmids encoding a His-Fur fusion protein were transformed into <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>BL21 (DE3) cells. Expression of His-Fur was induced by addition of isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG). The recombinant protein was purified under native conditions with a QIAexpressionist™ Ni-NTA affinity chromatography (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The purified, eluted protein was concentrated to approximately 0.3 mg ml<sup>-1 </sup>with the Amicon Ultra-15 (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The purity of His-Fur protein was verified by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Primers were designed to amplify the 400–500 bp promoter-proximate region extending upstream from the start codon of each first gene of the operons tested (Table S2 for list of oligonucleotide primers used in this study). EMSA was performed using the Gel Shift Assay Systems (Promega, Madison, WI). The DNA was 5'end-labeled using [γ-<sup>32</sup>P] ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. DNA binding was performed in a 10 μl reaction volume containing: binding buffer [100 μM MnCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 mM DTT, 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 0.05 mg ml<sup>-1 </sup>poly-(dI-dC)], labeled DNA (1000–2000 c.p.m. μl<sup>-1</sup>), and increasing amounts of His-Fur protein. We included two control reactions: one contained the specific DNA competitor (unlabeled promoter DNA), while the other was the nonspecific protein competitor [rabbit anti-F1-protein polyclonal antibody (IgG)]. After incubation at room temperature for 30 minutes (min), the products were loaded onto a native 4% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed in 0.5 × Tris-borate (TB) buffer containing 100 μM MnCl<sub>2 </sub>for 30 min at 220 V. Radioactive species were detected by autoradiography.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>YH participated in array experiments, data analysis and manuscript drafting.
